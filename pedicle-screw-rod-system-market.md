<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Rod System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li><li>Polyaxial Pedicle Screw Rod System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pedicle Screw Rod System market comprises two primary types: monoaxial and polyaxial systems. Monoaxial pedicle screws allow for rigid fixation in a single plane, offering stability, but limited flexibility. In contrast, polyaxial pedicle screws provide multidirectional angulation, accommodating varying anatomical requirements and enhanced versatility during implantation. This flexibility can lead to improved rod alignment and reduced stress on screws. Both types are crucial for spinal stabilization and are widely used in orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.</p></p>
